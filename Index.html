		<h3>Hi my name is Emma I am the creator of this website.</h3> 
		<h3>It is to help you with any problems relating with being bullied.</h3>
		<h3>Also if you are the bully it is also going to help you with things that are going on in your life.</h3>
		<h3>It doesn't matter if you are an adult or a child this is for you to use, and to help you not feel so alone.</h3> 
		<h3>I know that it does get hard for some people to relate to others that have somewhat the same thing that had or is happing to them.</h3>
		<h3>Please try at least a week or two on here to see if you like it and if you don't that is also ok not everything is meant for everyone.</h3>
		<h3>Just because somethings might not help you right away or it gets to hard in life for you don't give up no matter if that happens.</h3> 
		<h3>If I did that every time I would get nowhere in life and this website would never get done.</h3>
		<h3>The one thing that I will get the most is if you are not ready to talk or get out of the shell that you are in that is okay.</h3>
		<h3>You know what you want and are capable of.</h3>
		<h3> But if you are ready to do that then try it and see what happens.</h3>
