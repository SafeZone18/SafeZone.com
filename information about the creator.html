<p>Hi again! As you can tell from the title this is about me the person that made this website. I live by a small town Seneca Illinois. I am the baby sister of five, three older sisters and one older bother.  My mom and dad are divorced since I was in preschool. That was hard for years my mom wasn't around that much because she had to work, but it hurt her because she barely got to see us. The times that she didn't have work or the weekends that me and one of my sisters didn't go to our dads, where so fun. When we would visit my dads were also fun.</p>     
<p>When I started to make this website was when, I was 15 years old. The idea of making the website was when I was in 7 grade I got tired of people making others feel so bad about them selves that I just wanted do something, but I didn't know how. So the website idea came I was thinking on how to do it and what to do on it. There was one thing I didn't know how to make one. Because I didn't know anything about coding. I knew that I had to learn how to code before anything, after I realized this. I decided to help myself and learn how to code. I want to help people and I didn't know how to now making this website will help a lot of people I hope. </p> 
<p>I will tell you my story about how I was both a victim and a bully. Yeah I know you probable don't really want to hear it but hopefully it might help. I went to Nettle Creek Elementary School, this is where everything happened. It started when I was in second grade, the other kids in my class started to exclude me from somethings and I didn't see what was going on. Throughout the years that I was at Nettle Creek my friendship with the teachers grew, but with the kids in my grade and both grades below me I knew that they wouldn't be my same age friends. The bullying got worse my fifth grade I didn't know what to do. You would go and tell a teacher or a different adult but I didn't.</p> 
<p>Two girls in my class and one from the higher grade were so mean and rude I didn't know what to do about, but do the same back to them or at least try to. By the time sixth grade came it got better but it didn't stop I was at the point of were I was always mad and I started to get very depressed. I was yelling and fighting with my older siblings. I started to have thoughts of committing suicide but it was just that, thoughts. I do have them from time to time but I never try anything. All I wnat to do is stop thinking about removing myself from the world. I do hit or scratch myslef but that is about it. I do think at times that my family would be better off without me. Now I think less of it, and I do hope to not feel or think this way for the long run.</p>
